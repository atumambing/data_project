# README

Goal
The goal of this project is to create a Ruby on Rails application using data collected from one or more data sources.

The first part involves creating the required database tables and pulling data from various data sources. The second part involves using Ruby on Rails to create reports, allow searching, and/or display visualizations based on this data.


*********** THINGS TO DO ***********
/ = FINISHED


1 - Gathering and Storing Data

/🌟 🕯️ 1.1 - Select one or more data sources that you wish to pull data from. Write a short description of the data you are planning to use, how the data is structured, and the required database tables and columns you will require. This description should also explain how data you pull from different sources is related or how you plan to integrate the different datasets.

/💡 1.2 - Create a ERD diagram to document the schema of the database you plan on building for this project. This ERD should be based on your research from 1.1.


/1.3 - Use Rails to generate the Active Record models and tables required to store the data from the data sources described above. This might include any required join tables, as well as tables for related fake data generated using the Faker gem.

	🕯️ 1.3 Two tables are created and will be populated with data in 1.7.
	💡 1.3 Three tables are created and will be populated with data in 1.7.
/	🔥 1.3 Four or more tables are created and will be populated with data in 1.7.

/🌟💡 1.4 - Add an association to your ActiveRecord models to define a one-to-many relationship. (This association must be used in 3.x or 4.x features.)

/🔥 1.5  Add an association to your models to define a many-to-many relationship through a join table. (This association must be used in 3.x or 4.x features.)

/💡 1.6 - Add two or more appropriate validations to all of your ActiveRecord models to ensure that the data you import into your tables will be valid.

1.7 - Write the seeds.rb script to pull in the data from your various sources into your database. You can use Faker as one of your data sources. Multiple endpoints from the same API are considered a single source. (Minimum number of rows across all tables: 200)

	🕯️ 1.7 Data is pulled from a single data source.
	💡 1.7 Data is pulled from a two data sources.
  	🔥 1.7 Data is pulled from from three or more data sources.

2 - Web Site Navigation

🕯️ 2.1 - Your web application has an about page that includes the details about your data sources from 1.1 and optionally your ERD from 1.2.

💡 2.2 - There is a menu present on all pages that includes links to two or more locations. (For example, a menu with a link to your homepage and your about page.)

3 - Data Navigation

🌟 🕯️ 3.1 - There exists a way for the user to navigate through the data you’ve collected at a high level. (For example, table or list of the entire data collection.)

💡 3.2 - There exists a page for each of the individual entries of the data you have collected to display all the attributes of the collected data point.

💡 3.3 - On the individual entry pages (3.2) data pulled from associated models is also present.

🔥 3.4 - Data can be navigated by category or hierarchically based on a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship.

💡 3.5 - Large collections of data are presented using pagination. (See the kaminari gem.)

🔥 3.6 - Location data is present on a map (either one map for the entire collection or a separate map for each data point). The map can be provided using the Google Static Map API or Google Maps Javascript. (Google Maps API now requires a credit card to activate your API key. For low usage projects the API is still free. An alternative would be the Map Box Static Map API.)

4 - Searching and Filtering

🌟 🕯️ 4.1 - Users can use a simple form to perform a text search through the available data.

💡 4.2 - A user’s search can be restricted to a specific category (or other one-to-many / many-to-many relationship) using a dropdown within the search form.

5 - Markup and Design

🌟 🕯️ 5.1 - All HTML generated by your app validates as HTML5 with no errors.

🕯️ 5.2 - At least one of your ERB views includes a conditional (if or unless).

💡 5.3 - You built your markup and styling around the Bootstrap (or another similar) CSS framework . (At a minimum your layout should be built around your framework’s grid system.)

6 - Source Control

/🌟 🕯️ 6.1 - You have configured git and github to keep your source under control with the ability to push from master to origin.

/🕯️ 6.2 - You’ve used git to keep your source under control with a minimum of 20 commits. Commits must be accompanied by reasonable commit messages.
